The player controls the rocket ship with the arrow keys and can move left to right only.

A fleet of alien ships enter the screen from top to bottom and players can shoot them down 
with the spacebar.

If a alien ship hits the players ship or it reaches the bottom of the screen, 
the player loses a ship. 

Each player gets three ships (three lives)

If a player destorys all the alien ships in the screen, a new set of alien ships will be created 
and will be faster than the previous set.

The game ends when the player loses three ships.
